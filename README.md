# mi-eng
engines for norns based on mutable instruments adaptations. 

Based on the supercollider UGens by Volker Bohm https://github.com/v7b1/mi-UGens

Ugens can be downloaded here: https://llllllll.co/t/mi-ugens-for-norns/31781

### installation

On norns the directories in the ugen archive should be installed at `/home/we/.local/share/SuperCollider/Extensions`

Once youâ€™ve installed the ugens, SLEEP and restart your norns.

### norns engines

The norns engines here should be added to `~/dust/code` like any other script package
